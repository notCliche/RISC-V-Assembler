# RISC-V-Assembler
This is a RISC-V Assembler written in C++. The file assembler.cpp contains the assembler while the file RISCV_CARD.pdf is a reference manual for RISC-V instructions.

For now I have only included the base instructions and not extensions such as Multiply, Floating Point, Atomic etc.
